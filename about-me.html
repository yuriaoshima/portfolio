        <p>An interesting fact about Yuri is that although her name is fully Japanese, she is not Japanese at all! Both of Yuri's parents are Chinese. Her name is Japanese because Yuri's parents moved to Japan and became Japanese citizens before she was born. In Japan, you must change your name to be Japanese in order to obtain citizenship. <img src="images/me-and-laura.jpg" alt="me and my best friend Laura"> <img src="images/honey-and-me-at-hotpot.jpg" alt="honey and me at hotpot"></p>
